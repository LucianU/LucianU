- 👋 Hi, I’m @LucianU a.k.a @elbear in different online communities
- 👀 I’m interested in making software development more accessible
- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on getting a solid graps of some of the fundamentals of software: 
     - data structures and algorithms
     - software architecture
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing at the moment. I'm not used to getting other people behind my projects. Not yet, at least
